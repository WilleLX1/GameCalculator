# GameCalculator
Welcome to GameCalculator! This program serves as a handy tool for playing a guessing game where players try to deduce each other's secret 4-digit numbers. It's perfect for adding an extra layer of fun and competition to game nights with friends and family!

# About
GameCalculator is a simple program designed to help players in a guessing game by generating possible guesses based on feedback received from their opponents. Whether you're playing with your siblings, friends, or colleagues, this program can give you the edge you need to outsmart your opponents and emerge victorious!

# How to Play
1. Setup: Each player selects a random 4-digit number with all digits being different. This will be their secret number that the opponent needs to guess.
2. Guessing: Players take turns guessing each other's secret numbers. When it's your turn to guess, simply input your opponent's guess, and the program will generate the next best guess based on the feedback received.
3. Feedback: After each guess, your opponent provides feedback in the format of "NRNW", where "N" represents the number of correct digits in the right place (R) and "W" represents the number of correct digits in the wrong place. For example, if the opponent's secret number is 1234 and your guess is 1253, the feedback might be "2R1W".
4. Iterate: The program continues to generate guesses based on the feedback until the correct number is guessed. The player who successfully guesses their opponent's secret number first wins the game!
